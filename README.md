A collection of all the data science projects done by me in the past. Codes are available as ipynb.

Here is a list of project you will find in this repository:

## 1. Cryptocurrency Exploration: The Bitcoin Market

In this Project, we intend to generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Using this natural language processing technique, we will try to understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.
