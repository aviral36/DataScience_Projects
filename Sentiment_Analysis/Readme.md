# Stock Trend Prediction Using News Headlines

### Project Summary
 
In earlier days, it used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds. As a fact, news articles are automatically being generated from figures and earnings call streams. In this Project, we intend to generate investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Using this natural language processing technique, we will try to understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.
 
 
### Technology Stack
 
This Project will require us to apply our Python skills, using it to manipulating data frames with libraries like pandas, numpy and visualising them using matplotlib. We will also require fundamental natural language processing knowledge. For this, we plan to use the NLTK in python. In addition, Beautiful Soup package may also be used to scrape data from HTML files on Finviz. Selenium has been planned for scraping Javascript files, in case dynamic page loads are encountered. 
Our data isnâ€™t large enough to require us to implement an external management system. However, we plan to use Apache Hadoop to enable multi-system parallel computing capabilities.


### Datasets

The datasets used in this project are raw HTML files for the Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) stocks from FINVIZ.com.
Finviz is a popular website dedicated to stock information and news, and has a publicly accessible API to retrieve stock information for our desired listed firm.
